# <span id="page-8-0"></span> **1 INTRODUCTION**

Starfield Technologies is an innovator in the field of Internet foundation services, providing advanced software and Internet solutions critical to the building of online presence and e-commerce.

The Starfield Public Key Infrastructure ("Starfield PKI") has been established to provide a variety of digital certificate services.

## <span id="page-8-1"></span> **1.1 Overview**

This Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (CP/CPS) describes the practices of the Starfield PKI and applies to all Certification Authorities (CAs) within the Starfield PKI hierarchy. This CP/CPS is applicable to all entities with relationships with the Starfield PKI, including Policy Authorities (PAs), Certification Authorities (CAs), Registration Authorities (RAs), Subscribers, and Relying Parties.

The Starfield PKI conforms to the current version of the *Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted TLS Server Certificates* as well as *Guidelines for Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certificates* and *Network and Certificate System Security Requirements* published at https://www.cabforum.org. In the event of any inconsistency between this document and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence over this document. The following policy identifiers are managed in accordance with these requirements: **2.23.140.1.2.1**, **2.23.140.1.2.2**, **2.23.140.1.2.3**, and **2.23.140.1.1**

*Note: References to Baseline Requirements sections are denoted in short form using the section number. For example [BR 3.2.2.1] denotes section 3.2.2.1 of the current revision of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted TLS Server Certificates.*

In addition, Starfield attests that it adheres to the latest published versions of the following policies and program requirements:

- CCADB Policy – <https://www.ccadb.org/policy>
- Chrome Root Program Policy – <https://googlechrome.github.io/chromerootprogram/>
- Microsoft Trusted Root Program Requirements – https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-requirements
- Mozilla Root Store Policy – https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/
- Apple Root Certificate Program https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html

This CP/CPS is structured according to the common outline set forth in RFC 3647, divided into nine primary components that cover the
security controls and practices and procedures for certificate issuance services within Starfield. To preserve the outline specified by
RFC 3647, section headings that do not apply have the statement "Not applicable" or "No stipulation."

## <span id="page-8-2"></span> **1.2 Document Name and Identification**

This document is formally referred to as the "Starfield Public TLS Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement" (Starfield CP/CPS). Starfield CAs issue certificates in accordance with the policy and practice requirements of this document.

The OID-arcs associated with this document are **2.16.840.1.114413** and **2.16.840.1.114414**.

## <span id="page-11-0"></span> **1.3 PKI Participants**

This CP/CPS is applicable to all certificates issued by Starfield CAs within the Starfield PKI. This document defines the specific communities for which a specific class or type of certificate is applicable, specific Starfield PKI practices and requirements for the issuance and management of such certificates, and the intended purposes and uses of such certificates.

### <span id="page-11-1"></span> **1.3.1 Certification Authorities**

Starfield Certification Authorities (CAs) perform the following general functions:

- Create and sign certificates
- Distribute certificates to the appropriate Subscribers and Relying Parties
- Revoke certificates
- Distribute certificate status information in the form of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or other mechanisms
- Provide a repository where certificates and certificate status information are stored and made available (if applicable).

Obligations of the CAs within the Starfield PKI include:

- Generating, issuing, and distributing public key certificates
- Distributing CA certificates
- Generating and publishing certificate status information (such as CRLs)
- Maintaining the security, availability, and continuity of the certificate issuance and CRL signing functions
- Providing a means for Subscribers to request revocation
- Revoking public-key certificates
- Periodically demonstrating internal or external audited compliance with this CP/CPS.

Within the Starfield PKI, there are two general types of CAs: Root and Issuing CAs. Currently, the Starfield PKI hierarchy consists of the CAs in the diagrams below. Relationships between these CA certificates are represented in the following diagrams:

# Certificate Hierarchies

### <span id="page-14-0"></span> **1.3.2 Registration Authorities**

Registration Authorities (RAs) evaluate and either approve or reject Subscriber certificate management transactions (including certificate requests, renewal and re-key requests, and revocation requests). Starfield serves as the sole RA for the Starfield PKI; Starfield does not delegate RA authority to unaffiliated third parties, but does rely on Delegated Third Parties for limited, well-defined functions as described below.

Root CAs. For Starfield Root CAs, the Subscribers are Subordinate CAs under Starfield's control. The RA function for these certificates is performed entirely manually by authorized Starfield PKI personnel, and certificate issuance additionally requires a deliberate, multi-person authorized command (see Section 4.3.1.1).

Issuing CAs. For Starfield Issuing CAs, the RA function combines automated and manual processing, varying by certificate type and risk profile:

- Domain Validated (DV) Certificates: Domain authorization/control validation (Section 3.2.2.4), CAA processing (Section 3.2.2.8), and Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration (Section 3.2.2.10) are fully automated. Automation in this context performs substantive validation determinations (i.e., pass/fail decisions on domain control and CAA permission), not merely workflow routing. Certificate requests flagged as high-risk by internal or third-party fraud/phishing data sources (Section 4.2.1) are automatically routed for mandatory manual review before issuance.
- Organization Validated (OV) Certificates: Domain control validation is automated as above. Organization identity, address, and DBA/tradename verification (Sections 3.2.2.1–3.2.2.2) and validation of the Applicant Representative's authority (Section 3.2.5) are performed manually by trained Validation Specialists, using automated tooling to query Reliable Data Sources but requiring human review and sign-off of the results.
- Extended Validation (EV) Certificates: All EV-specific verification and approval steps (Section 3.2, EV bullets) are performed manually by trained Validation Specialists. Consistent with Section 5.2.4, approval of an EV Certificate request must be performed by a person other than the person who performed the underlying verification (separation of duties); this approval can never be automated.

Functions that always require human approval, regardless of certificate type:

- Approval of any certificate request flagged as high-risk, suspicious, or previously rejected/revoked for fraud (Section 4.2.1);
- All EV verification and approval steps (separation of duties per Section 5.2.4);
- Root CA certificate issuance (Section 4.3.1.1);
- Any manual override of an automated validation failure.

**Role of automation** - Automated systems perform domain control and CAA validation determinations, generate and check Random Values/Request Tokens, run Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration, and lint each to-be-signed certificate for technical conformance with the Baseline Requirements prior to signing (Sections 4.3.1.2–4.3.1.3). Automation is not limited to workflow routing — for DV issuance, the automated validation result is itself the basis for issuance authorization, subject to linting and CAA gating controls that can block issuance even after validation passes.

**Delegated Third Parties** - Where a Delegated Third Party (as defined in Section 1.6.1) participates in the Certificate Management Process — for example, providing or hosting a Random Value used in DNS Change domain validation (Section 3.2.2.4.7) — Starfield remains fully responsible for the resulting validation and issuance decision. Starfield authorizes Delegated Third Parties only under a written agreement that obligates them to comply with the applicable requirements of this CP/CPS and the Baseline Requirements, and Starfield does not treat any output from a Delegated Third Party as a substitute for Starfield's own validation, approval, or issuance-authorization functions. 

For the Starfield Root CAs the Subscribers are Subordinate CAs that are under the control of Starfield. Accordingly, the RA function for these CAs is performed manually by authorized Starfield PKI personnel.

For the Starfield Issuing CAs, the RA function is performed by Starfield using a combination of automated and manual processes.

### <span id="page-14-1"></span> **1.3.3 Subscribers**

For the Root CAs, the Subscribers include subordinate CAs. For Starfield Issuing CAs, Subscribers typically include organizations and individuals. In some situations, Starfield may act as an Applicant or Subscriber, for instance, when it generates and protects a Private Key, requests a Certificate, demonstrates control of a Domain, or obtains a Certificate for its own use.

Obligations of Subscribers within the Starfield PKI include:

- Generating or causing to be generated one or more asymmetric key pairs
- Submitting public keys and credentials for registration
- Providing information to the RA that is accurate and complete to the best of the Subscribers' knowledge and belief regarding information in their certificates and identification and authentication information
- Taking appropriate measures to protect their private keys from compromise
- Promptly reporting loss or compromise of private key(s) and inaccuracy of certificate information
- Using its key pair(s) in compliance with this CP/CPS.

### <span id="page-14-2"></span> **1.3.4 Relying Parties**

Relying Parties include any entity that may rely upon a Starfield certificate for purposes of determining the organizational or individual identity of an entity providing a web site, data encryption, digital signature verification, and user authentication.

Obligations of Relying Parties within the Starfield PKI include:

- Confirming the validity of Subscriber public-key certificates
- Verifying that Subscriber possesses the asymmetric private key corresponding to the public-key certificate (e.g., through digital signature verification)
- Using the public-key in the Subscriber's certificate in compliance with this CP/CPS.

### <span id="page-15-0"></span> **1.3.5 Other Participants**

Not applicable.

## 1.4 Certificate Usage

Certificates issued under this CP/CPS are intended for the trust purpose of TLS server authentication.

Starfield offers TLS Certificates in the following levels of assurance:

| _Assurance Level_ | _Certificate Validation Type_ |
|---|---|
| _Basic and Medium Assurance_ | Domain Validation (DV) |
| _High Assurance_ | Organization and Individual Validation (OV) |
| _Extended Validation_ | Extended Validation (EV) |

Subscriber certificates issued under this CP/CPS require the Extended Key Usage value **id-kp-serverAuth (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)**. Certain certificate profiles issued under this CP/CPS may also include **id-kp-clientAuth (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)**, as specified in the applicable certificate profile.

_Note: As of May 30, 2021, Starfield no longer issues High Assurance Code Signing Certificates and will no longer update this CP/CPS for Code Signing related changes to the Baseline Requirements. Code Signing references were removed in v4.12. Refer to Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement v4.11 in Starfield's Repository for the most recent policy containing Code Signing references._

### <span id="page-15-2"></span> **1.4.1 Appropriate Certificate Uses**

A certificate issued by Starfield shall be used only as designated by the terms of this CP/CPS and any service agreements. However, the sensitivity of the information processed or protected by a Certificate varies greatly, and each Relying Party must evaluate the associated risks before deciding on whether to rely on a Certificate issued under this CP/CPS.

### <span id="page-15-3"></span> **1.4.2 Prohibited Certificate Uses**

As defined in the applicable Subscriber Agreement.

Certificate Applicants are prohibited from using names in their Certificate Applications that infringe upon others' Intellectual Property Rights. Starfield does not verify whether a Certificate Applicant has Intellectual Property rights in the name appearing in a Certificate Application nor does Starfield arbitrate, mediate, prosecute, or otherwise resolve any dispute concerning the ownership of any domain name, trade name, trademark, or service mark. Starfield may, without liability to any Certificate applicant, reject or suspend any Certificate application because of such dispute.

## <span id="page-26-0"></span> **3.2 Initial Identity Validation**

For Basic and Medium Assurance Domain Validated SSL Server Certificate Subscribers, Starfield verifies the following:

- the individual requesting the certificate has access to the domain name(s) that are specified in the certificate application using the methods described in [Section 3.2.2.4 Validation of Domain Authorization or Control.](#page-27-0)

For High Assurance Organizational Validated SSL Server Certificate Subscribers, Starfield verifies the following:

- the individual requesting the certificate has access to the domain name(s) that are specified in the certificate application using the methods described in [Section 3.2.2.4 Validation of Domain Authorization or Control.](#page-27-0)
- the individual requesting the certificate is authorized to do so by the organization named in the certificate using the methods described in [Section 3.2.5 Validation of Authority](#page-33-2)
- the organization name represents an organization validated using the methods described in [Section 3.2.2 Authentication of Organization and Domain Identity.](#page-26-2)

For Extended Validation SSL Server Certificate Subscribers, Starfield verifies:

- Legal Existence and Identity;
- Assumed name, when applicable;
- Physical existence and business presence;
- Operational existence, when required;
- A Verified Method of Communication with the Applicant;
- Control of the domain name(s) included in the Certificate;
- The name, title, and authority of the Contract Signer, Certificate Approver, and Certificate Requester, as applicable;
- Authorization of the Subscriber Agreement; and
- Approval of the EV Certificate Request.

Starfield verifies Applicant organization information using applicable authoritative or independent sources, as described in Sections 3.2.2.1 through 3.2.2.3. As part of verifying the authority of individuals acting in EV roles, Starfield contacts the Applicant using a verified telephone number and confirms the individual's authority to act on behalf of the Applicant in the applicable role.

Starfield verifies that the Contract Signer is authorized to enter into the Subscriber Agreement on behalf of the Applicant, that the Certificate Approver is authorized to approve EV Certificate Requests, and that Certificate Requesters are authorized to submit EV Certificate Requests on behalf of the Applicant. The applicable validations and approvals must be completed prior to issuance, and — consistent with Section 5.2.4 — approval of the EV Certificate Request must be performed by a person other than the Validation Specialist who verified the underlying information.

*Note: Effective as of 1 October 2020, before using an incorporating or registration agency for validation of an Extended Validation Certificate, that agency is disclosed publicly via <https://ssltools.godaddy.com/compliance/Approved_Incorporating_and_Registration_Agencies.xlsx>. This document, Approved Incorporating and Registration Agencies, contains the name of the agency, jurisdiction(s) and website information as well as a document history including version numbers and publication dates for all edits.* 

### <span id="page-26-1"></span> **3.2.1 Method to Prove Possession of Private Key**

The Subscriber's certificate request must contain the public key to be certified and be digitally signed with the corresponding private key.

### <span id="page-26-2"></span> **3.2.2 Authentication of Organization and Domain Identity**

#### <span id="page-26-3"></span> **3.2.2.1 Identity**

If the Subject Identity Information is to include the name or address of an organization, Starfield verifies the identity and address of the organization and that the address is the Applicant's address of existence or operation using documentation provided by, or through communication with, at least one of the following:

1. A government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal creation, existence, or recognition;
2. A third party database that is periodically updated and considered a Reliable Data Source;
3. A site visit by Starfield or a third party who is acting as an agent for Starfield; or
4. An Attestation Letter.

Starfield may use the same documentation or communication described in 1 through 4 above to verify both the Applicant's identity and address, or Starfield may verify the address of the Applicant (but not the identity of the Applicant) using a utility bill, bank statement, credit card statement, government-issued tax document, or other form of identification determined to be reliable.

#### <span id="page-27-0"></span> **3.2.2.2 DBA/Tradename**

If the Subject Identity Information is to include a DBA or tradename, Starfield verifies the Applicant's right to use the DBA/tradename using at least one of the following:

1. Documentation provided by, or communication with, a government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal creation, existence, or recognition;
2. A Reliable Data Source;
3. Communication with a government agency responsible for the management of such DBAs or tradenames;
4. An Attestation Letter accompanied by documentary support; or
5. A utility bill, bank statement, credit card statement, government-issued tax document, or other form of identification that the Starfield determines to be reliable.

#### <span id="page-27-1"></span> **3.2.2.3 Verification of Country**

If the subject:countryName field is present, then Starfield shall verify the country associated with the Subject using one of the following:

1. The IP Address range assignment by country for either
	* A. The web site's IP address, as indicated by the DNS record for the web site, or
	* B. The Applicant's IP address;
2. The ccTLD of the requested Domain Name;
3. Information provided by the Domain Name Registrar; or
4. A method identified in [Section 3.2.2.1 Identity.](#page-26-3)

#### <span id="page-27-2"></span> **3.2.2.4 Validation of Domain Authorization or Control**

Domain names included in the Subject Common Name or Subject Alternative Name fields of an End Entity Certificate may be Fully-Qualified or wildcard. 

Verification of domain name access is performed when a domain name is first requested for a certificate in a given customer account.

Verification of domain name access may be performed when a Subscriber requests the renewal of a certificate in accordance with [Section 4.6 Certificate Renewal.](#page-37-5)

Effective March 15, 2026: DNSSEC validation back to the IANA DNSSEC root trust anchor must be performed on all DNS queries associated with the validation of domain authorization or control by the Primary Network Perspective. The DNS resolver used for all DNS queries associated with the validation of domain authorization or control by the Primary Network Perspective must:

1. Perform DNSSEC validation using the algorithm defined in RFC 4035 Section 5; and<br>
2. Support NSEC3 as defined in RFC 5155; and <br>
3. Support SHA-2 as defined in RFC 4509 and RFC 5702; and <br>
4. Properly handle the security concerns enumerated in RFC 6840 Section 4. <br>

Effective 2026-03-15: For e-mail Domain Validation methods described in sections 3.2.2.4.4, 3.2.2.4.13, 3.2.2.4.14, DNSSEC validation back to the IANA DNSSEC root trust anchor MUST be performed on all DNS CNAME, CAA, TXT queries attempting to obtain the Authorization Domain Name associated with the validation of domain authorization or control by the Primary Network Perspective and Starfield MUST NOT use local policy to disable DNSSEC validation. For all other DNS queries, DNSSEC validation back to the IANA DNSSEC root trust anchor SHOULD be performed and Starfield SHOULD NOT use local policy to disable DNSSEC validation.

For all other Domain Validation methods, DNSSEC validation back to the IANA DNSSEC root trust anchor MUST be performed on all DNS queries associated with the validation of domain authorization or control by the Primary Network Perspective and Starfield MUST NOT use local policy to disable DNSSEC validation on any DNS query associated with the validation of domain authorization or control.

DNSSEC validation back to the IANA DNSSEC root trust anchor is considered outside the scope of self-audits performed to fulfill the requirements in Section 8.7.

DNSSEC validation back to the IANA DNSSEC root trust anchor is considered outside the scope of the logging requirements of Section 5.4.1.

For each Fully-Qualified Domain Name listed in a Certificate, Starfield confirms that, as of the date the Certificate was issued, the Applicant either is the Domain Name Registrant or has control over the FQDN by using one or more of the following methods below. These procedures are intended to comply with the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements.

##### 3.2.2.4.1 **Validating the Applicant as a Domain Contact**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.2 **Email, Fax, SMS, or Postal Mail to Domain Contact**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.3 **Phone Contact with Domain Contact**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.4 **Constructed Email to Domain Contact**

Communicating with the Domain's administrator by (i) using an email address created by pre-pending 'admin', 'administrator', 'webmaster', 'hostmaster', or 'postmaster' in the local part, followed by the at-sign ("@"), followed by an Authorization Domain Name, (ii) including a Random Value in the email, and (iii) receiving a confirming response utilizing the Random Value.

Effective March 15, 2028:

Starfield MUST NOT rely on this method.
Prior validations using this method and validation data gathered according to this method MUST NOT be used to issue Subscriber Certificates.

##### 3.2.2.4.5 **Domain Authorization Document**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.6 **Agreed-Upon Change to Website**

This method of domain validation is not used. Starfield does use method Agreed-Upon Change to Website v2 in accordance with Section 3.2.2.4.18.

##### 3.2.2.4.7 **DNS Change**

Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by confirming the presence of a Random Value generated by Starfield in a DNS TXT or CAA record for an Authorization Domain Name or an Authorization Domain Name that is prefixed with a Domain Label that begins with an underscore character. 

If a Random Value is used, Starfield or Delegated Third Party SHALL provide a Random Value unique to the certificate request and SHALL not use the Random Value after (i) 30 days or (ii) if the Applicant submitted the certificate request, the timeframe permitted for reuse of validated information relevant to the certificate.

Starfield has implemented a Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration as specified in [BR 3.2.2.9] whereby a Network Perspective observes the same challenge information (i.e. Random Value or Request Token) as the Primary Network Perspective.

Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, Starfield MAY also issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the Domain Labels of the validated FQDN. This method is suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.

##### 3.2.2.4.8 **IP Address**

No IP address certificates are issued under this CPS.

##### 3.2.2.4.9 **Test Certificate**

Starfield does not validate domain authorization or control by confirming presence of a Test Certificate.

##### 3.2.2.4.10 **TLS Using a Random Value**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.11 **Any Other Method**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.12 **Validating Applicant as a Domain Contact**

Confirming the Applicant is the Domain Name Contact directly with the Domain Name Registrar by determining that the domain was registered using the same account as the certificate. 

Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, Starfield MAY also issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the Domain Labels of the validated FQDN. This method is suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.

Effective January 15, 2025:
- When issuing Subscriber Certificates, Starfield MUST NOT rely on Domain Contact information obtained using an HTTPS website, regardless of whether previously obtained information is within the allowed reuse period.
- When obtaining Domain Contact information for a requested Domain Name, Starfield:
	- if using the WHOIS protocol (RFC 3912), MUST query IANA's WHOIS server and follow referrals to the appropriate WHOIS server.
	- if using the Registry Data Access Protocol (RFC 7482), MUST utilize IANA's bootstrap file to identify and query the correct RDAP server for the domain.
	- MUST NOT rely on cached 1) WHOIS server information that is more than 48 hours old, or 2) RDAP bootstrap data from IANA that is more than 48 hours old, to ensure that it relies upon up-to-date and accurate information.

##### 3.2.2.4.13 **Email to DNS CAA Contact**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.14 **Email to DNS TXT Contact**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.15 **Phone Contact with Domain Contact**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.16 **Phone Contact with DNS TXT Record Phone Contact**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.17 **Phone Contact with DNS CAA Phone Contact**

This method of domain validation is not used.

##### 3.2.2.4.18 **Agreed-Upon Change to Website v2**

Confirming the Applicant's control over the FQDN by verifying that the Request Token or Random Value is contained in the contents of a file.

1. The entire Request Token or Random Value MUST NOT appear in the request used to retrieve the file, and
2. The CA MUST receive a successful HTTP response from the request (meaning a 2xx HTTP status code must be received).

The file containing the Request Token or Random Value:

1. MUST be located on the Authorization Domain Name, and
2. MUST be located under the "/.well-known/pki-validation" directory, and
3. MUST be retrieved via either the "http" or "https" scheme, and
4. MUST be accessed over an Authorized Port.

If the CA follows redirects, the following apply:

1. Redirects MUST be initiated at the HTTP protocol layer.
	* a. For validations performed on or after December 1, 2021, redirects MUST be the result of a 301, 302, or 307 HTTP status code response, as defined in [RFC 7231, Section 6.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4), or a 308 HTTP status code response, as defined in [RFC 7538, Section 3.](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7538#section-3) Redirects MUST be to the final value of the Location HTTP response header, as defined in [RFC 7231, Section 7.1.2.](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2)
	* b. For validations performed prior to December 1, 2021, redirects MUST be the result of an HTTP status code result within the 3xx Redirection class of status codes, as defined in RFC 7231, Section 6.4. Starfield SHOULD limit the accepted status codes and resource URLs to those defined within 1.a.
2. Redirects MUST be to resource URLs with either the "http" or "https" scheme.
3. Redirects MUST be to resource URLs accessed via Authorized Ports.

If a Random Value is used, then:
1. The CA MUST provide a Random Value unique to the certificate request.
2. The Random Value MUST remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 30 days from its creation. 

Starfield has implemented a Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration as specified in [BR 3.2.2.9] whereby a Network Perspective observes the same challenge information (i.e. Random Value or Request Token) as the Primary Network Perspective.

*Note:* 
*For Certificates issued prior to December 1, 2021, Starfield MAY also issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN. This method is suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.* 
*For Certificates issued on or after December 1, 2021, Starfield MUST NOT issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN unless Starfield performs a separate validation for that FQDN using an authorized method. This method is NOT suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.*

##### 3.2.2.4.19 **Agreed-Upon Change to Website - ACME**

Confirming the Applicant's control over a FQDN by validating domain control of the FQDN using the ACME HTTP Challenge method defined in [Section 8.3 of RFC 8555](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8555.txt).

Additionally, Starfield MUST receive a successful HTTP response from the request (meaning a 2xx HTTP status code must be received).

The token (as defined in [Section 8.3 of RFC 8555](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8555.txt). ) MUST NOT be used for more than 30 days from its creation.

If the CA follows redirects, the following apply:
1.	Redirects MUST be initiated at the HTTP protocol layer.
	* a.	For validations performed on or after July 1, 2021, redirects MUST be the result of a 301, 302, or 307 HTTP status code response, as defined in [RFC 7231, Section 6.4](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt), or a 308 HTTP status code response, as defined in [RFC 7538, Section 3](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7538.txt). Redirects MUST be to the final value of the Location HTTP response header, as defined in [RFC 7231, Section 7.1.2](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt).
	* b.	For validations performed prior to July 1, 2021, redirects MUST be the result of an HTTP status code result within the 3xx Redirection class of status codes, as defined in [RFC 7231, Section 6.4](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt). 
2.	Redirects MUST be to resource URLs with either the "http" or "https" scheme.
3.	Redirects MUST be to resource URLs accessed via Authorized Ports.

Starfield has implemented a Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration as specified in [BR 3.2.2.9] whereby a Network Perspective observes the same challenge information (i.e. Random Value or Request Token) as the Primary Network Perspective.

*Note:* 
*For Certificates issued prior to December 1, 2021, Starfield MAY also issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN. This method is suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.*
*For Certificates issued on or after December 1, 2021, Starfield MUST NOT issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN unless Starfield performs a separate validation for that FQDN using an authorized method. This method is NOT suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.*

##### 3.2.2.4.20 **TLS Using ALPN**

While the issuing CAs under Starfield’s direct control, Certainly issuing CAs MAY confirm the Applicant’s control over an FQDN by validating domain control using the TLS ALPN challenge method. Under this method, the Applicant provisions the required challenge response on the target server, the CA connects to the server over TLS using the specified ALPN value, and the CA verifies the expected challenge content before issuance. This method is intended to comply with BR 3.2.2.4.20.

##### 3.2.2.4.21 **DNS Labeled with Account ID - ACME**

While the issuing CAs under Starfield’s direct control, do not use this method of validation, Certainly issuing CAs MAY confirm the Applicant’s control over the FQDN by verifying the presence of the required DNS challenge value at the DNS location associated with the Applicant’s ACME account identifier. The challenge value must be unique to the certificate request and validated prior to issuance. This method is intended to comply with BR 3.2.2.4.21.

#### <span id="page-31-0"></span> **3.2.2.5 Authentication for an IP Address**

While the issuing CAs under Starfield’s direct control, do not issue TLS certificates containing IPAddress type SAN entries,  Certainly issuing CAs MAY confirm control of an IP Address by validating the Applicant’s control using the ACME HTTP challenge for IP addresses or the ACME TLS ALPN challenge for IP addresses. Under these methods, the CA verifies that the Applicant can provision the required challenge response at the requested IP address prior to issuance.

#### <span id="page-31-1"></span> **3.2.2.6 Wildcard Domain Validation**

Before issuing a Wildcard Certificate, Starfield MUST establish and follow a documented procedure that determines if the FQDN portion of any Wildcard Domain Name in the Certificate is "registry‐controlled" or is a "public suffix" (e.g. "*.com", "*.co.uk", see [RFC 6454 Section 8.2](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6454.txt) for further explanation).

If the FQDN portion of any Wildcard Domain Name is "registry‐controlled" or is a "public suffix", Starfield MUST refuse issuance unless the Applicant proves its rightful control of the entire Domain Namespace. (e.g. Starfield MUST NOT issue "*.co.uk" or "*.local", but MAY issue "*.example.com" to Example Co.).

Determination of what is "registry‐controlled" versus the registerable portion of a Country Code Top‐Level Domain Namespace is not standardized at the time of writing and is not a property of the DNS itself. Current best practice is to consult a "public suffix list" such as the Public Suffix List (PSL), and to retrieve a fresh copy regularly.

If using the PSL, a CA SHOULD consult the "ICANN DOMAINS" section only, not the "PRIVATE DOMAINS" section. The PSL is updated regularly to contain new gTLDs delegated by ICANN, which are listed in the "ICANN DOMAINS" section. A CA is not prohibited from issuing a Wildcard Certificate to the Registrant of an entire gTLD, provided that control of the entire namespace is demonstrated in an appropriate way.

#### **3.2.2.7 Data Source Accuracy**

Prior to using any data source as a Reliable Data Source, Starfield evaluates the source for its reliability, accuracy, and resistance to alteration or falsification. Starfield considers the following during its evaluation:

1. The age of the information provided,
2. The frequency of updates to the information source,
3. The data provider and purpose of the data collection,
4. The public accessibility of the data availability, and
5. The relative difficulty in falsifying or altering the data.

Databases maintained by Starfield, its owner, or its affiliated companies do not qualify as a Reliable Data Source if the primary purpose of the database is to collect information for the purpose of fulfilling the validation requirements under this section.

#### **3.2.2.8 CAA Records**

As part of certificate issuance, Starfield retrieves and processes CAA records for each applicable dNSName in the subjectAltName extension. Starfield evaluates the issue, issuewild, and iodef property tags, respects the critical flag, and will not issue a certificate where CAA processing indicates issuance is not permitted. These procedures are intended to comply with RFC 8659.

Some methods relied upon for validating the Applicant's ownership or control of the subject domain(s) require CAA records to be retrieved and processed from additional remote Network Perspectives before Certificate issuance. 

To corroborate the Primary Network Perspective, a remote Network Perspective's CAA check response MUST be interpreted as permission to issue, regardless of whether the responses from both Perspectives are byte-for-byte identical. Additionally, Starfield MAY consider the response from a remote Network Perspective as corroborating if one or both of the Perspectives experience an acceptable CAA record lookup failure.

Starfield may check CAA records at any other time.

When processing CAA records, Starfield MUST process the issue, issuewild, and iodef property tags as specified in [RFC 8659](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8659.txt) as described in Section 4.2.1 of this CP/CPS., although they are not required to act on the contents of the iodef property tag. Additional property tags MAY be supported, but MUST NOT conflict with or supersede the mandatory property tags set out in this document. Starfield MUST respect the critical flag and not issue a certificate if they encounter an unrecognized property tag with this flag set.

If Starfield issues a certificate after processing a CAA record, it MUST do so within the TTL of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater.

[RFC 8659](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8659.txt) requires that Starfield “MUST NOT issue a certificate unless the CA determines that either (1) the certificate request is consistent with the applicable CAA RRset or (2) an exception specified in this CP/CPS applies.”

Starfield MUST document potential issuances that were prevented by a CAA record in sufficient detail to provide feedback to the CA/Browser Forum on the circumstances, and SHOULD dispatch reports of such issuance requests to the contact(s) stipulated in the CAA iodef record(s), if present. Starfield may not support URL schemes in the iodef record other than mailto: or https:.

*Note: Starfield does not issue certificates for Onion Domain Names*

###### 3.2.2.8.1 DNSSEC Validation of CAA Records

Effective March 15th, 2026: DNSSEC validation back to the IANA DNSSEC root trust anchor MUST be performed on all DNS queries associated with CAA record lookups performed by the Primary Network Perspective. The DNS resolver used for all DNS queries associated with CAA record lookups performed by the Primary Network Perspective MUST: perform DNSSEC validation using the algorithm defined in RFC 4035 Section 5; and support NSEC3 as defined in RFC 5155; and support SHA-2 as defined in RFC 4509 and RFC 5702; and properly handle the security concerns enumerated in RFC 6840 Section 4.

Effective March 15th, 2026: Starfield MUST NOT use local policy to disable DNSSEC validation on any DNS query associated CAA record lookups.

Effective March 15th, 2026: DNSSEC-validation errors observed by the Primary Network Perspective (e.g., SERVFAIL) MUST NOT be treated as permission to issue.

DNSSEC validation back to the IANA DNSSEC root trust anchor MAY be performed on all DNS queries associated with CAA record lookups performed by Remote Network Perspectives as part of Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration.

DNSSEC validation back to the IANA DNSSEC root trust anchor is considered outside the scope of self-audits performed to fulfill the requirements in Section 8.7.

##### 3.2.2.9 Other Verification Requirements

###### 3.2.2.9.1 Denied Lists and Other Legal Block Lists

Starfield MUST verify whether the Applicant, the Contract Signer, the Certificate Approver, the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation, Registration, or Place of Business:

1. Is identified on any government denied list, list of prohibited persons, or other list that prohibits doing business with such organization or person under the laws of the country of the CA’s jurisdiction(s) of operation, as per Section 3.2.2.12.2 of the EV Guidelines; or
2. Has its Jurisdiction of Incorporation, Registration, or Place of Business in any country with which the laws of the CA’s jurisdiction prohibit doing business.

Starfield MUST NOT issue any EV Certificate to the Applicant if either the Applicant, the Contract Signer, or Certificate Approver or if the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration or Place of Business is on any such list.

###### 3.2.2.9.2 Parent/Subsidiary/Affiliate Relationship

When verifying an Applicant using information of the Applicant’s Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate, Starfield MUST verify an Applicant using information of the Applicant’s Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate. Acceptable methods of verifying the Applicant’s relationship to the Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate include the following, as per Section 3.2.2.12.3 of the EV Guidelines:

1. QIIS or QGIS
2. Independent Confirmation from the Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate
3. Contract between CA and Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate
4. Verified Professional Letter
5. Corporate Resolution

#### **3.2.2.10 Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration**
Starfield has implemented Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration using at least five (5) remote Network Perspectives that fall within at least two (2) distinct Regional Internet Registries. Starfield ensure that the requirements defined in Quorum Requirements Table below are satisfied and the remote Network Perspectives that corroborate the Primary Network Perspective fall within the service
regions of at least two (2) distinct Regional Internet Registries in order to proceed with issuance of the Certificate.

| # of Distinct Remote Network Perspectives Used | # of Allowed non-Corroborations |
|---|---|
| 2-5 | 1 |
| 6+ | 2 |

Starfield MAY use either the same set, or different sets of Network Perspectives when performing Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration for the required 1) Domain Authorization or Control and 2) CAA Record checks.

The set of responses from the relied upon Network Perspectives MUST provide Starfield with the necessary information to allow it to affirmatively assess:

a. the presence of the expected 1) Random Value, 2) Request Token, 3) IP Address, or 4) Contact Address; and  
b. b) the CA's authority to issue to the requested domain(s),

Results or information obtained from one Network Perspective MUST NOT be reused or cached when performing validation through subsequent Network Perspectives (e.g., different Network Perspectives cannot rely on a shared DNS cache to prevent an adversary with control of traffic from one Network Perspective from poisoning the DNS cache used by other Network Perspectives). The network infrastructure providing Internet connectivity to a Network Perspective MAY be administered by the same organization providing the computational services required to operate the Network Perspective.

All communications between a remote Network Perspective and Starfield MUST take place over an authenticated and encrypted channel relying on modern protocols (e.g., over HTTPS).

A Network Perspective MAY use a recursive DNS resolver that is NOT co-located with the Network Perspective. However, the DNS resolver used by the Network Perspective MUST fall within the same Regional Internet Registry service region as the Network Perspective relying upon it. Furthermore, for any pair of DNS resolvers used on a Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration attempt, the straight-line distance between the two DNS resolvers MUST be at least 500 km. The location of a DNS resolver is determined by the point where unencapsulated outbound DNS queries are typically first handed off to the network infrastructure providing Internet connectivity to that DNS resolver.

Starfield does not rely on corroborations from previous attempts. There is no stipulation regarding the maximum number of validation attempts that may be performed in any period of time.

Starfield MAY reuse corroborating evidence for CAA record quorum compliance for a maximum of 398 days. After issuing a Certificate to a domain, remote Network Perspectives may omit retrieving and processing CAA records for the same domain or its subdomains in subsequent Certificate requests from the same Applicant for up to a maximum of 398 days.

### <span id="page-33-0"></span> **3.2.3 Authentication of Individual Identity**

For High Assurance Individual Subscribers, Starfield verifies the following:

- the individual requesting the certificate has access to the domain name(s) that are specified in the certificate application using the methods described in [Section 3.2.2.4 Validation of Domain Authorization or Control.](#page-27-0)
- the identity of the individual named in the certificate application using the following methods:
	- Starfield verifies the Applicant's name using a legible copy, which discernibly shows the Applicant's face, of at least one currently valid government‐issued photo ID (passport, drivers license, military ID, national ID, or equivalent document type).
	- Starfield verifies the Applicant's address using a form of identification that the CA determines to be reliable, such as a government ID, utility bill, or bank or credit card statement.
	- Starfield verifies the certificate request with the Applicant using a Reliable Method of Communication.

### <span id="page-33-1"></span> **3.2.4 Non-verified Subscriber Information**

Not applicable.

### <span id="page-33-2"></span> **3.2.5 Validation of Authority**

If the Applicant for a Certificate containing Subject Identity Information is an organization, Starfield uses a Reliable Method of Communication including email, telephone, and postal services to verify the authenticity of the Applicant Representative's certificate request. Using a Reliable Method of Communication, Starfield establishes the authenticity of the certificate request directly with the Applicant Representative or with an authoritative source within the Applicant's organization, such as the Applicant's main business offices, corporate offices, human resource offices, information technology offices, or other department Starfield deems appropriate.

In addition, Starfield has a process that allows an Applicant to specify the individuals who may request Certificates. If an Applicant specifies, in writing, the individuals who may request a Certificate, then Starfield does not accept any certificate requests that are outside this specification. Starfield will provide an Applicant with a list of its authorized certificate requesters upon the Applicant's verified written request.

### <span id="page-34-0"></span> **3.2.6 Criteria for Interoperation**

Refer to [Section 10.3 Cross CA Certificates](#page-93-0) for all cross certificates that identify the CA as the Subject.

## <span id="page-34-1"></span> **3.3 Identification and Authentication for Re-key Requests**

### <span id="page-34-2"></span> **3.3.1 Identification and Authentication for Routine Re-key**

Subscriber requests for routine re-key are authenticated using a shared secret.

### <span id="page-34-3"></span> **3.3.2 Identification and Authentication for Re-key After Revocation**

The process for re-key after revocation of a Subscriber certificate is complete re-enrollment, which requires the generation of a new Subscriber key pair and the re-performance of the initial Subscriber identification and authentication procedures specified in [Section 3.2 Initial Identity Validation.](#page-26-0)

## <span id="page-34-4"></span> **3.4 Identification and Authentication for Revocation Request**

[Section 4.9 Certificate Revocation and Suspension](#page-39-9) describes requirements for identification and authentication of revocation requests.

When revocation is initiated by Starfield, identification and authentication is not required.

# <span id="page-35-0"></span> **4 CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

## <span id="page-35-1"></span> **4.1 Certificate Application**

Certificate applications must include all information required by the relevant Starfield certificate application form.

### <span id="page-35-2"></span> **4.1.1 Who Can Submit a Certificate Application**

Either the Applicant or an authorized Certificate Requestor may submit certificate requests.

Starfield maintains an internal database of all previously revoked Certificates and previously rejected certificate requests due to suspected phishing or other fraudulent usage or concerns and uses this information to identify subsequent suspicious certificate requests.

### <span id="page-35-3"></span> **4.1.2 Enrollment Process and Responsibilities**

Enrollment requires a completed certificate request, acceptance or execution of a Subscriber Agreement, and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) containing the public key to be signed.

## <span id="page-35-4"></span> **4.2 Certificate Application Processing**

### <span id="page-35-5"></span> **4.2.1 Performing Identification and Authentication Functions**

When a certificate application is received, Starfield performs the validation required for the type of certificate in question as described in [Section 3.2 Initial Identity Validation.](#page-26-0)

Prior to issuing a certificate, Starfield processes [RFC 6844](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6844.txt) Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) records for each FQDN in the certificate according to the requirements defined in the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted TLS Server Certificates. Starfield recognizes the following set of issuer domain names in CAA "issue" or "issuewild" records as permitting certificate issuance:

- godaddy.com
- starfieldtech.com

Starfield supports the Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Record Extensions for Account URI and ACME Method Binding, as specified in [RFC 8657](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8657.txt).
The following values are accepted:

| CAA extension | Acceptable Patterns |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
|`accounturi`   | https://acme.secureserver.net/v1/acme/accounts/{acmeAccountId}|
|               | https://secureserver.net/account/{customerId} |
|               | https://acme.godaddy.com/v1/acme/accounts/{acmeAccountId} |
|               | https://godaddy.com/account/{customerId} |
|`validationmethods` | Acme: `dns-01` , `http-01`|
|                    | Non-Acme: `ca-dns`(3.2.2.4.7), `ca-http`(3.2.2.4.18), `ca-email`(3.2.2.4.4), `ca-account`(3.2.2.4.12) |


Starfield relies on internal and 3rd party data to identify high risk Certificate requests prior to the Certificate's approval and denies these requests and/or subjects them to additional verification procedures.

Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) containing mixed character sets within a label may be subjected to additional verification procedures.

In cases where the certificate request does not contain all the necessary information about the Applicant, the Starfield shall obtain the remaining information from the Applicant or, having obtained it from a reliable, independent, third-party data source, confirm it with the Applicant.

Starfield MAY use the documents and data provided in Section 3.2 to verify certificate information, or may reuse previous validations themselves, provided that Starfield obtained the data or document from a source specified under Section 3.2 or completed the validation itself within the maximum number of days prior to issuing the Certificate, as defined in the following table:

**Organization Validation - Subject Identity Information validation data reuse periods**

| **Certificate issued on or after** | **Certificate issued before** | **Maximum data reuse period** |
|---|---|---|
|  | 2026-03-15 | 825 days |
| 2026-03-15 |  | 398 days |

For validation of Domain Names according to Section 3.2.2.4, any data, document, or completed validation used MUST be obtained within the maximum number of days prior to issuing the Certificate, as defined in the following table:

**Domain Validation - Domain Name and IP Address validation data reuse periods**

| **Certificate issued on or after** | **Certificate issued before** | **Maximum data reuse period** |
|---|---|---|
|  | 2026-03-15 | 398 days |
| 2026-03-15 | 2027-03-15 | 200 days |
| 2027-03-15 | 2029-03-15 | 100 days |
| 2029-03-15 |  | 10 days |

**Extended Validation**

In the case of EV SSL Certificates, Starfield may rely on a previously verified certificate request to issue a replacement certificate, so long as the certificate being referenced was not revoked due to fraud or other illegal conduct, if:

1. The expiration date of the replacement certificate is the same as the expiration date of the EV Certificate that is being replaced; and
2. The Subject Information of the Certificate is the same as the Subject in the EV Certificate that is being replaced.

The age of all data used to support issuance of an EV Certificate (before revalidation is required) SHALL NOT exceed the following limits:

- Legal Existence and Identity – 398 days
- Assumed Name – 398 days
- Physical Existence – 398 days
- Operational Existence – 398 days
- Domain ownership or exclusive right to use – 398 days
- Name, title, and authority of contract signer, certificate approver, and certificate requester – 398 days, unless a contract between Starfield and the Applicant specifies a different term, in which case, the term specified in such contract controls.

The 398-day period set forth above SHALL begin to run on the date the information was collected by Starfield.

Starfield may reuse a previously submitted EV Request, Subscriber Agreement, or Terms of Use, including use of a single EV Certificate Request in support of multiple EV Certificates containing the same Subject to the extent permitted under the relevant agreement.

### <span id="page-36-0"></span> **4.2.2 Approval or Rejection of Certificate Applications**

Starfield will reject any Certificate application that cannot be verified. Starfield may also reject a certificate application if Starfield believes that issuing the Certificate could damage or diminish Starfield's reputation or business.

Starfield enforces separation of validation duties to ensure that no one person can single-handedly validate and authorize the issuance of EV Certificates.

Effective 2026-03-15, Starfield SHALL NOT issue Certificates containing Domain Names that end in an IP Reverse Zone Suffix.

### <span id="page-36-1"></span> **4.2.3 Time to Process Certificate Applications**

Certificate applications made to CAs under Starfield's direct control may be rejected if domain validation is not completed within 45 days from certificate request. The RA can choose to extend this timeframe on an individual basis.

## <span id="page-36-2"></span> **4.3 Certificate Issuance**

### <span id="page-36-3"></span> **4.3.1 CA Actions During Certificate Issuance**

Certificates are generated, issued and published only after the RA performs the required identification and authentication steps in accordance with [Section 4.2.1 Performing Identification and Authentication Functions](#page-35-5) and [Section 3.2 Initial Identity Validation.](#page-26-0)

#### <span id="page-36-4"></span> **4.3.1.1 Manual Authorization of certificate issuance for Root CAs**

Certificate issuance by any Starfield Root CA requires an individual authorized by Starfield to deliberately issue a direct command in order for the Root CA to perform a certificate signing operation. This operation is performed with the participation from multiple trusted roles.

#### <span id="page-36-5"></span> **4.3.1.2 Linting of to-be-signed Certificate content**

Starfield has implemented a Linting process to test the technical conformity with the BRs of each to-be-signed artifact prior to signing it. 

#### <span id="page-36-6"></span> **4.3.1.3 Linting of issued Certificates**

Starfield may use a Linting process to test issued Certificates.

### <span id="page-36-7"></span> **4.3.2 Notification to Subscriber by the CA of Issuance of Certificate**

Subscribers are notified of issuance via email or API methods.

## <span id="page-36-8"></span> **4.4 Certificate Acceptance**

### <span id="page-36-9"></span> **4.4.1 Conduct Constituting Certificate Acceptance**

A Subscriber's receipt of a certificate and subsequent use of the key pair and certificate constitute certificate acceptance. By accepting a certificate, the Subscriber:

- Agrees to be bound by the continuing responsibilities, obligations and duties imposed by this CP/CPS,
- Agrees to be bound by the Subscribing Party agreement, and
- Represents and warrants that to its knowledge no unauthorized person has had access to the private key associated with the certificate, and
- Represents and warrants that the certificate information it has supplied during the registration process is truthful and has been accurately and fully published within the certificate.

### <span id="page-37-0"></span> **4.4.2 Publication of the Certificate by the CA**

CA certificates are published in the Starfield repository.

All SSL certificates are published in one or more publicly accessible Certificate Transparency (CT) logs.

### <span id="page-40-0"></span> **4.9.1 Circumstances for Revocation**

#### <span id="page-40-1"></span> **4.9.1.1 Reasons for Revoking a Subscriber Certificate**

Starfield SHALL revoke a Certificate within 24 hours and using the corresponding CRL Reason from [Section 7.2.2 CRL and CRL Entry Extensions](#page-68-4) if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Subscriber requests in writing that Starfield, without specifying a reason, revoke the Certificate (CRLReason "**unspecified** (0)" which results in no ReasonCode extension being provided);
2. The Subscriber notifies Starfield that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization (CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
3. Starfield obtains evidence that the Subscriber's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise (CRLReason 1, **keyCompromise**);
4. Starfield is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that can easily compute the Subscriber's Private Key based on the Public Key in the Certificate, such as a Debian weak key, see [https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys](https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys)(CRLReason 1, **keyCompromise**);
5. Starfield obtains evidence that the validation of domain authorization or control for any Fully‐Qualified Domain Name or IP address in the Certificate should not be relied upon (CRLReason 4, **superseded**);.

Starfield may revoke a certificate within 24 hours and will revoke a Certificate within 5 days and use the corresponding CRLReason if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5 Key Sizes](#page-57-6) and [Section 6.1.6 Public Key Parameters Generation and Quality Checking](#page-59-0) of this CP/CPS (CRLReason 4, **superseded**);
2. Starfield obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused (CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
3. Starfield is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use (CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
4. Starfield is made aware of any circumstance indicating that use of a Fully‐Qualified Domain Name or IP address in the Certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or arbitrator has revoked a Domain Name Registrant's right to use the Domain Name, a relevant licensing or services agreement between the Domain Name Registrant and the Applicant has terminated, or the Domain Name Registrant has failed to renew the Domain Name) (CRLReason 5, **cessationOfOperation**);
5. Starfield is made aware that a Wildcard Certificate has been used to authenticate a fraudulently misleading subordinate Fully‐Qualified Domain Name (CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
6. Starfield is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the Certificate (CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
7. Starfield is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with these Requirements or this CP/CPS (CRLReason 4, **superseded**);
8. Starfield determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate (CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
9. Starfield's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless Starfield has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository (CRLReason "**unspecified** (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL);
10. Revocation is required by this CP/CPS for a reason that is not otherwise required to be specified by this section (CRLReason "**unspecified** (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL); or
11. Starfield is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber's Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed (CRLReason #1, **keyCompromise**).

If a CRL entry is for a Certificate not subject to these Requirements and was either issued onor-after 2020-09-30 or has a **notBefore** on-or-after 2020-09-30, the CRLReason MUST NOT be **certificateHold** (6). If a CRL entry is for a Certificate subject to these Requirements, the CRLReason MUST NOT be **certificateHold** (6).

If a **reasonCode** CRL entry extension is present, the CRLReason MUST indicate the most appropriate reason for revocation of the Certificate.

CRLReason MUST be included in the **reasonCode** extension of the CRL entry corresponding to a Subscriber Certificate that is revoked after July 15, 2023, unless the CRLReason is "**unspecified** (0)". Revocation reason code entries for Subscriber Certificates revoked prior to July 15, 2023, do NOT need to be added or changed.

Only the following CRLReasons MAY be present in the CRL **reasonCode** extension for Subscriber Certificates:

**keyCompromise** [(RFC 5280](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt) CRLReason #1): Indicates that it is known or suspected that the Subscriber's Private Key has been compromised;

**affiliationChanged** [(RFC 5280](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt) CRLReason #3): Indicates that the Subject's name or other Subject Identity Information in the Certificate has changed, but there is no cause to suspect that the Certificate's Private Key has been compromised;

**superseded** [(RFC 5280](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt) CRLReason #4): Indicates that the Certificate is being replaced because: the Subscriber has requested a new Certificate, the CA has reasonable evidence that the validation of domain authorization or control for any fully‐qualified domain name or IP address in the Certificate should not be relied upon, or the CA has revoked the Certificate for compliance reasons such as the Certificate does not comply with the Baseline Requirements or this CP/CPS;

**cessationOfOperation** [(RFC 5280](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt) CRLReason #5): Indicates that the website with the Certificate is shut down prior to the expiration of the Certificate, or if the Subscriber no longer owns or controls the Domain Name in the Certificate prior to the expiration of the Certificate; or

**privilegeWithdrawn** [(RFC 5280](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt) CRLReason #9): Indicates that there has been a subscriberside infraction that has not resulted in keyCompromise, such as the Certificate Subscriber provided misleading information in their Certificate Request or has not upheld their material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

The Subscriber Agreement, or an online resource referenced therein, MUST inform Subscribers about the revocation reason options listed above and provide explanation about when to choose each option. Tools that the CA provides to the Subscriber MUST allow for these options to be easily specified when the Subscriber requests revocation of their Certificate, with the default value being that no revocation reason is provided (i.e. the default corresponds to the CRLReason "**unspecified** (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL).

The **privilegeWithdrawn** reasonCode SHOULD NOT be made available to the Subscriber as a revocation reason option, because the use of this reasonCode is determined by the CA and not the Subscriber.

When a CA obtains verifiable evidence of Key Compromise for a Certificate whose CRL entry does not contain a **reasonCode** extension or has a reasonCode extension with a nonkeyCompromise reason, the CA SHOULD update the CRL entry to enter **keyCompromise** as the CRLReason in the **reasonCode** extension. Additionally, the CA SHOULD update the revocation date in a CRL entry when it is determined that the private key of the certificate was compromised prior to the revocation date that is indicated in the CRL entry for that certificate.

*Note: Backdating the revocationDate field is an exception to best practice described in* [RFC 5280](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt)  [section 5.3.2](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt); however, these requirements specify the use of the revocationDate field to support TLS implementations that process the revocationDate field as the date when the Certificate is first considered to be compromised.*

### **4.9.1.2 Reasons for Revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate**

Starfield will revoke a Subordinate CA Certificate within seven (7) days if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Subordinate CA requests revocation in writing(CRLReason "**unspecified** (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL);;
2. The Subordinate CA notifies Starfield that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization (CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
3. Starfield obtains evidence that the Subordinate CA's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise or no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5 Key Sizes](#page-57-6) and [Section 6.1.6 Public Key Parameters Generation and Quality Checking](#page-59-0) of this CP/CPS (CRLReason 1, **keyCompromise**);
4. Starfield obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused(CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
5. Starfield is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with or that Subordinate CA has not complied with this document or the applicable Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement(CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
6. Starfield determines that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate or misleading(CRLReason 9, **privilegeWithdrawn**);
7. Starfield or the Subordinate CA ceases operations for any reason and has not made arrangements for another CA to provide revocation support for the Certificate(CRLReason 5, **cessationOfOperation**);
8. Starfield's or the Subordinate CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless Starfield has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository(CRLReason "**unspecified** (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL); or
9. Revocation is required by Starfield's CP/CPS(CRLReason "**unspecified** (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL).

### <span id="page-43-0"></span> **4.9.2 Who Can Request Revocation**

Subscriber certificate revocation can be initiated by the Subscriber, Starfield, the Issuing CA, or authorized Resellers. Additionally, revocation requests can be initiated by anyone who can access the ACME API endpoint that can complete the revocation procedures in [Section 4.9.3 Procedure for Revocation Request.](#page-43-1)

### <span id="page-43-1"></span> **4.9.3 Procedure for Revocation Request**

Starfield maintains a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and related inquiries. 

Revocations may be requested:
- by Subscribers via their online account, which are authenticated using a shared secret; 
- by Subscribers using the appropriate ACME API endpoint, if they can sign the revocation request with the associated account private key; 
- by anyone who can access the appropriate ACME API endpoint and sign a revocation request with the private key associated with the certificate; or 
- by anyone who can access appropriate ACME API endpoint and demonstrate control over all domains in the Subject; or
- by any individual via email to the practices@starfieldtech.com who has reason to believe there is a certificate problem which may require revocation

If the revocation request cannot be authenticated using a shared secret or through the ACME endpoint, the RA must perform sufficient procedures to authenticate the revocation request in accordance with Starfield’s revocation request processing procedures.

For reporting suspected private key compromise, certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other type of suspicious activity with a certificate, contact Starfield by email at [practices@starfieldtech.com.](mailto:practices@starfieldtech.com) or by phone at (480) 505-8852.

### <span id="page-43-2"></span> **4.9.4 Revocation Request Grace Period**

Starfield validates automated revocation requests (i.e., where a shared secret is correctly provided) on receipt.  Starfield commences the validation of non-automated revocation requests within one business day of receipt.

Starfield immediately processes authenticated revocation requests.  A certificate’s revoked status is reflected on a CRL and/or in an OCSP response published at intervals specified below.  Revoked certificates are listed in the CRL and in OCSP responses until the certificate expires. 

*Note: As of May 30, 2021, Starfield no longer issues High Assurance Code Signing Certificates. While no longer issued, any revoked Code Signing certificates which had been issued by Starfield are retained on the CRL and in OCSP responses for 10 years after the latter of the certificate revocation or expiration.*

### <span id="page-44-0"></span> **4.9.5 Time Within Which CA Must Process the Revocation Request**

Within 24 hours after receiving a Certificate Problem Report, Starfield will investigate the facts and circumstances related to a Certificate Problem Report and provide a preliminary report on its findings to both the Subscriber and the entity who filed the Certificate Problem Report.

After reviewing the facts and circumstances, Starfield will work with the Subscriber and any entity reporting the Certificate Problem Report or other revocation-related notice to establish whether or not the certificate will be revoked, and if so, a date which Starfield will revoke the certificate. The period from receipt of the Certificate Problem Report or revocation-related notice to published revocation MUST NOT exceed the time frame set forth in [Section 4.9.1.1 Reasons for Revoking a Subscriber Certificate.](#page-40-1) The date selected by Starfield will consider the following criteria:

1. The nature of the alleged problem (scope, context, severity, magnitude, risk of harm);
2. The consequences of revocation (direct and collateral impacts to Subscribers and Relying Parties);
3. The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
4. The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement official that a Web site is engaged in illegal activities should carry more weight than a complaint from a consumer alleging that they didn't receive the goods they ordered); and
5. Relevant legislation.

### <span id="page-44-1"></span> **4.9.6 Revocation Checking Requirement for Relying Parties**

Relying Parties are required to check certificate status using the applicable CRL and/or OCSP before relying upon a certificate.

### <span id="page-44-2"></span> **4.9.7 CRL Issuance Frequency**

CRLs for CAs under Starfield's direct control are issued in accordance with the following table:

| CA Type     | CRL Publication Frequency                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Root CAs    | Every 365 days or less and upon certificate revocation |
| Issuing CAs | Every 24 hours                                         |

The value of the nextUpdate field MUST NOT be more than 365 days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field for Root CAs and 10 days for Issuing CAs.

### <span id="page-44-3"></span> **4.9.8 Maximum Latency for CRLs (if applicable)**

No Stipulation.

### <span id="page-45-0"></span> **4.9.9 On-line Revocation/Status Checking Availability**

Relying Parties are required to check certificate status using the applicable CRL and/or OCSP before relying upon a certificate.

The validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the thisUpdate and nextUpdate field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds shall be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds shall be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.

A certificate serial is “assigned” if:
- a Certificate or Precertificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA; or
- a Precertificate with that serial number has been issued by a Precertificate Signing Certificate, as defined in [BR 7.1.2.4], associated with the Issuing CA.

A certificate serial is “unassigned” if it is not “assigned”.

The following SHALL apply for communicating the status of Certificates and Precertificates which include an Authority Information Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod.

OCSP responders operated by Starfield support the HTTP GET method, as described in [RFC 6960](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6960.txt) and/or [RFC 5019](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5019.txt). Additionally, Starfield may process the Nonce extension (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.2) in accordance with RFC 8954.

For the status of a Subscriber Certificate or its corresponding Precertificate:
- Effective 2025-01-15, an authoritative OCSP response MUST be available (i.e. the responder MUST NOT respond with the “unknown” status) starting no more than 15 minutes after the Certificate or Precertificate is first published or otherwise made available.
- For OCSP responses with validity intervals less than sixteen hours, Starfield will provide an updated OCSP response prior to one-half of the validity period before the nextUpdate.
- For OCSP responses with validity intervals greater than or equal to sixteen hours, Starfield will provide an updated OCSP response at least eight hours prior to the nextUpdate, and no later than four days after the thisUpdate.

For the status of a Subordinate CA Certificate, Starfield will provide an updated OCSP response at least every twelve months, and within 24 hours after revoking the Certificate.

The following SHALL apply for communicating the status of all Certificates for which an OCSP responder is willing or required to respond.

OCSP responses conform to [RFC 6960](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6960.txt) and/or [RFC 5019](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5019.txt). OCSP responses either:
1.	Are signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2.	Are signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose revocation status is being checked.

In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate contains an extension of type id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck, as defined by [RFC 6960](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6960.txt).

OCSP responses for Subscriber Certificates MUST have a validity interval greater than or equal to eight hours and less than or equal to ten days.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for the status of a certificate serial number that is “unassigned”, then the responder SHOULD NOT respond with a “good” status. If the OCSP responder is for a CA that is not Technically Constrained in line with [BR 7.1.2.3] or [BR 7.1.2.5], the responder MUST NOT respond with a “good” status for such requests.

### <span id="page-45-1"></span> **4.9.10 On-line Revocation Checking Requirements**

The following SHALL apply for communicating the status of Certificates which include an Authority Information Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod.

OCSP responders operated by Starfield support the HTTP GET method, as described in [RFC 6960](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6960.txt) and/or [RFC 5019](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5019.txt). The CA MAY process the Nonce extension (`1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.2`) in accordance with RFC 8954.

The validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the thisUpdate and nextUpdate field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds shall be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds shall be equal to one day, ignoring leap‐seconds.

For the status of Subscriber Certificates and Subordinate CA Certificates:

- Starfield OCSP responses have a validity interval between 24 and 96 hours.
- Starfield updates the information provided via an OCSP at least eight hours prior to the nextUpdate.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for status of a certificate that has not been issued, then the responder does not respond with a "good" status.

### <span id="page-45-2"></span> **4.9.11 Other Forms of Revocation Advertisements Available**

Starfield does not require OCSP stapling.

### <span id="page-45-3"></span> **4.9.12 Special Requirements Regarding Key Compromise**

There is no deviation from the certificate revocation or Certificate Problem Report procedures specified above when the revocation of a Subscriber certificate is due to private key compromise.

Parties may use the following methods to demonstrate private key compromise:

- Submission of the private key
- Submission of a CSR signed by the private key
- Submission of a revoke request following the procedures defined in [Section 7.6 of RFC 8555](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8555.txt) requiring signing the revocation request with the compromised key

If a key compromise is successfully proven, Starfield will revoke the certificate according to the specifications in [Section 4.9 Certificate Revocation and Suspension.](#page-39-9)

In addition to the procedures specified above, if deemed necessary, Starfield uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify potential Relying Parties if Starfield discovers, or has reason to believe, that there has been a compromise of a Starfield CA private key.

### <span id="page-46-0"></span>**4.9.13 Circumstances for Suspension**

We do not perform certificate suspension.

### <span id="page-46-1"></span>**4.9.14 Who Can Request Suspension**

## <span id="page-46-4"></span>**4.10 Certificate Status Services**

### <span id="page-46-5"></span>**4.10.1 Operational Characteristics**

Starfield publishes certificate status information via CRL and/or OCSP. Revocation entries remain on the CRL and OCSP responses until after the certificate's expiration date.

Starfield publishes both full master CRLs and partitioned CRLs. URLs to partitioned CRLs are included in the certificate and master CRLs are published on the Starfield repository.

### <span id="page-46-6"></span>**4.10.2 Service Availability**

Starfield shall operate and maintain its CRL and optional OCSP capability with resources sufficient to provide a response time of ten (10) seconds or less under normal operating conditions.

Starfield's CRL and OCSP services incorporate a distributed design intended to provide 24x7 availability.

The Starfield PKI allows Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Vendors, and other third parties to report complaints or suspected Private Key compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, or inappropriate conduct related to Certificates via email as published in the Starfield repository.

Starfield maintains a continuous 24/7 ability to respond to any high priority certificate problem reports and to revoke certificates in accordance with [Section 4.9 Certificate Revocation and Suspension](#page-39-9) and/or report the problem to law enforcement officials.

# <span id="page-57-0"></span> **6 TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS**

## <span id="page-57-1"></span> **6.1 Key Pair Generation and Installation**

### <span id="page-57-2"></span> **6.1.1 Key Pair Generation**

Starfield CA key pairs are generated in and protected by hardware security modules certified to FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or FIPS 140-3 Level 3. CA key pair generation requires the participation of multiple trusted employees.

Subscriber key pair generation is performed by the Subscriber. It is recommended that the Subscriber use a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or FIPS 140-3 Level 3 certified cryptographic module for key generation.

#### **6.1.1.1 CA Key Pair Generation**

For CA Key Pairs that are either:
1.	used as a CA Key Pair for a Root Certificate or
2.	used as a CA Key Pair for a Subordinate CA Certificate, where the Subordinate CA is not the operator of the Root CA or an Affiliate of the Root CA,

Starfield will:
1.	prepare and follow a Key Generation Script
2.	have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process or record a video of the entire CA Key Pair generation process, and
3.	have a Qualified Auditor issue a report opining that the CA followed its key ceremony during its Key and Certificate generation process and the controls used to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the Key Pair.

For other CA Key Pairs that are for the operator of the Root CA or an Affiliate of the Root CA, Starfield will prepare and follow a Key Generation Script and may have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process or record a video of the entire CA Key Pair generation process.

In all cases, Starfield will:
1.	generate the CA Key Pair in a physically secured environment as described in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;
2.	generate the CA Key Pair using personnel in Trusted Roles under the principles of multiple person control and split knowledge;
3.	generate the CA Key Pair within cryptographic modules meeting the applicable technical and business requirements as stated in 6.1.1 Key Pair Generation
4.	log its CA Key Pair generation activities; and
5.	maintain effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that the Private Key was generated and protected in conformance with the procedures described in this CP/CPS and (if applicable) its Key Generation Script.

#### **6.1.1.2 RA Key Pair Generation**

No Stipulation.

#### **6.1.1.3 Subscriber Key Pair Generation**

Starfield will reject a certificate request if one or more of the following conditions are met:
1.	The Key Pair does not meet the requirements set forth in [BR 6.1.5] and/or [BR 6.1.6];
2.	There is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed;
3.	Starfield is aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Applicant's Private Key to compromise;
4.	Starfield has previously been notified that the Applicant's Private Key has suffered a Key Compromise using the procedure for revocation request as described in 4.9.3	Procedure for Revocation Request.
5.	The Public Key corresponds to an industry-demonstrated weak Private Key. For requests submitted on or after November 15, 2024, at least the following precautions SHALL be implemented:
	-	In the case of Debian weak keys vulnerability (https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys), Starfield will reject all keys found at https://github.com/cabforum/Debian-weak-keys/ for each key type (e.g. RSA, ECDSA) and size listed in the repository. For all other keys meeting the requirements of [BR 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes), with the exception of RSA key sizes greater than 8192 bits, Starfield will reject Debian weak keys.
	-	In the case of ROCA vulnerability, Starfield will reject keys identified by the tools available at https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca or equivalent.
	-	In the case of Close Primes vulnerability (https://fermatattack.secvuln.info/), Starfield will reject weak keys which can be factored within 100 rounds using Fermat’s factorization method.  

Suggested tools for checking for weak keys can be found here: https://cabforum.org/resources/tools/

### <span id="page-57-3"></span> **6.1.2 Private Key Delivery to Subscriber**

Starfield CA key pairs do not require delivery as they are generated and managed by the Starfield PKI. As Subscriber key pairs are generated by the Subscriber, there is no private key transportation requirement.

### <span id="page-57-4"></span> **6.1.3 Public Key Delivery to Certificate Issuer**

CA certificate requests are generated and processed by Starfield employees using a controlled process that requires the participation of multiple trusted individuals. CA certificate requests are PKCS #10 requests and accordingly contain the requesting CA's public key and are digitally signed by the requesting CA's private key.

For Subscriber certificate requests, the Subscriber's public key is submitted to the CA using a certificate request signed with the Subscriber's private key. This mechanism ensures that:

- the public key has not been modified during transit and
- the sender possesses the private key corresponding to the transferred public key.

### <span id="page-57-5"></span> **6.1.4 CA Public Key Delivery to Relying Parties**

The Starfield Root CA is made available to Relying Parties through its inclusion in common browser software.

The Starfield Root CA certificates may also be downloaded from the Starfield repository. A 256 bit SHA-256 hash of the Starfield Root CA certificates is posted in the Starfield repository so that users may verify the authenticity of the Starfield Root CA certificates.

### <span id="page-57-6"></span> **6.1.5 Key Sizes**

Starfield CA key pairs used to issue certificates after January 1, 2012 are 2048 bit or higher RSA keys. Subscriber key pairs in certificates issued after January 1, 2012 are 2048 bit or higher RSA keys.

Certificates meet the following requirements for algorithm type and key size.
